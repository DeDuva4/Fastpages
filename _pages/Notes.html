    <h2>Problems with changing themes</h2>
    
    <p>
        Although most themes look better than the original fastpages theme, the
    functionality of the site will be affected. Pages, tags, and search bar
    become unaccessible after switching themes.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Night at the Museum</h2>
    
    <p>
        At the night at the museum, I saw many other interesting CSP projects
    as well as some CSA projects. I also saw some people from other classes and
    looked at the interesting things that they were doing. In Ceramics I saw
    artifacts that people made out of clay. In 3D animation people made donuts.
    The pictures I took are below.

    <h2>College Board Multiple Choice Corrections</h2>
    <p>
        Question 11: The correct answer is A because the function only compares
        the elements to other elements after them in the list. I got this question
        wrong because I didn't realize that it only compares the element with
        index x to an element with index x+1. This only compares elements to
        other elements after them in a list.
    </p>
    <p>    
        Question 13: The correct answer is C because it won't return the desired result.
        When you try running that code, the code will return true, because the last
        element that is indexed is positive.
    </p>
        <p>Question 17: The correct answer is D because the internet protocols are used
        to standardize the data transmission between different devices. This is the main
        reason why we ues them so much.
    </p>
        <p>Question 29: The correct answer is A because lists can be beneficial because
        of their ability to easily change in size to hold as much data as needed. We use
        lists because they can adapt to hold as much data as needed.
    </p>
        <p>Question 45: The correct answer is B because 0 will be counted and increment Count2.
            Code sees zeroes as positive, so they are counted as >0 in Count2.
    </p>
