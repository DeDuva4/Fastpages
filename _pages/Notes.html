    <h2>Problems with changing themes</h2>
    
    <p>
        Although most themes look better than the original fastpages theme, the
    functionality of the site will be affected. Pages, tags, and search bar
    become unaccessible after switching themes.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Night at the Museum</h2>
    
    <p>
        At the night at the museum, I saw many other interesting CSP projects
    as well as some CSA projects. I also saw some people from other classes and
    looked at the interesting things that they were doing. In Ceramics I saw
    artifacts that people made out of clay. In 3D animation people made donuts.
    The pictures I took are below.

    <h2>College Board Multiple Choice Corrections</h2>
    <p>
        Question 11: The correct answer is A because the function only compares
        the elements to other elements
        after them in the list.
    </p>
    <p>    
        Question 13: The correct answer is C because it won't return the desired result.
    </p>
        <p>Question 17: The correct answer is D because the internet protocols are used
        to standardize the data transmission between different devices.
    </p>
        <p>Question 29: The correct answer is A because lists can be beneficial because
        of their ability to easily change in size to hold as much data as needed.
    </p>
        <p>Question 45: The correct answer is B because 0 will be counted and incriment Count2.
