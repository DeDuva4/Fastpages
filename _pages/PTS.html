            <td> <center> The video describes the overall purpose of the program and how it works. It also clearly shows the input and output of the program. This gets a few extra points because it goes more in depth in all explanations, and is more precise. </center> </td>
            <td> <center> The video for student 1 was very short and could have explained everything a lot further, whereas student 2 explained everything clearly and took their time. </center> </td>

            <td> <center> Data Abstraction </center> </td>
            <td> <center> Uses variables and lists to store data in a way that can be used in the program. The variable names make the code easier to understand. </center> </td>
            <td> <center> Uses variables and lists to store data in a way that can be used in the program. This is basically at the same standard as the first video. </center> </td>
            <td> <center> Both are very good examples of code that utilizes data abstraction in lists. </center> </td>

            <td> <center> Includes iteration, sequencing, and selection, and uses a function that is very understandable. </center> </td>
            <td> <center> Includes all the same fundamental college board criteria. Uses many understandable functions. </center> </td>
            <td> <center> Both are good but they don't have anything special. They would receive their points though. </center> </td>
