<h1 id="Why-do-virtual-assistants-have-female-voices">Why do virtual assistants have female voices<a class="anchor-link" href="#Why-do-virtual-assistants-have-female-voices"> </a></h1><ul>
<li>Companies have spent lots more time collecting voice samples from females</li>
<li>Female voices tend to articulate better and are usually easier to understand</li>
<li>Can be harmful because kids can get influenced to expecting a female assistant</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Analysis">Analysis<a class="anchor-link" href="#Analysis"> </a></h4><p>There are many reasons why female voices are mostly used, but the most prominant is probably that females voice data was collected, and its easier to understand. It is just easier to make a female voiced, virtual assistant than a mans voice, in todays day and age.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="Analysis">Analysis<a class="anchor-link" href="#Analysis"> </a></h4><p>These algorithms can be very harmful because they are designed to make you waste as much time as possible. They make you unproductive as they suck up all of your time and attention into useless things that you would probably forget the next day.</p>
