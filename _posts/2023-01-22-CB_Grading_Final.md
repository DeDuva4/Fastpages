# Student 1 Scoring

| Category | Checklist | My Score | CB Score |
| :--- | :--- | :----: | :----: |
| Program Purpose and Function | <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1"> <label for="vehicle1"> Describes the overall purpose of the program demonstrated in the video. </label><br> <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1"> <label for="vehicle1"> Describes what functionality of the program is demonstrated in the video. </label><br> <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1"> <label for="vehicle1"> Describes the input and output of the program. </label><br> | 1 | 1 |
| Data Abstraction | <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1"> <label for="vehicle1"> One program code that shows how data has been stored in this list (or another collection type). </label><br> <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1"> <label for="vehicle1"> One program code that shows the data in this same list being used as part of fulfilling the program’s purpose. </label><br> <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1"> <label for="vehicle1"> Identifies the name of the variable representing the list being used in this response. </label><br> <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1"> <label for="vehicle1"> Describes what the data contained in this list is representing in the program. </label><br> | 0 | 0 |
| Managing Complexity | <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1"> <label for="vehicle1"> Includes a program code segment that shows a list being used to manage complexity in the program. </label><br> <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1"> <label for="vehicle1"> Explains how the named, selected list manages complexity in the program code by explaining why the program code could not be written, or how it would be written differently, without using this list. </label><br> | 0 | 0 |
| Procedural Abstraction | <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1"> <label for="vehicle1"> One program code showing a student-developed procedure with at least one parameter that has an effect on the functionality of the procedure. </label><br> <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1"> <label for="vehicle1"> One program code showing where the student-developed procedure is being called. </label><br> <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1"> <label for="vehicle1"> Describes what the identified procedure does and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program. </label><br> | 0 | 0 |
| Algorithm Implementation | <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1"> <label for="vehicle1"> Includes a program code segment of a student-developed algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration. </label><br> <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1"> <label for="vehicle1"> Explains in detailed steps how the identified algorithm works in enough detail that someone else could recreate it. </label><br> | 1 | 1 |
| Testing | <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1"> <label for="vehicle1"> Describes two calls to the selected procedure identified in written response 3c. Each call must pass a different argument(s) that causes a different segment of code in the algorithm to execute. </label><br> <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1"> <label for="vehicle1"> Describes the condition(s) being tested by each call to the procedure. </label><br> <input type="checkbox" id="vehicle1"> <label for="vehicle1"> Identifies the result of each call. </label><br> | 1 | 1 |
