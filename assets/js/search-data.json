Sequencing is Important! . Changing the order of the steps changes the overall outcome, since every time the value assigned to a variable is changed, it overrides the last value which was assigned to the same variable. That is why it is important to track the value of variables, especially in code where the value is constantly changing. . num1 = 2 num2 = 4 num3 = 6 num1 = num2 + num3 # num1 is now 4 + 6, which is 10 num2 = num1 + num3 # num2 is now (the new num1) 10 + 6, which is 16 # output: num1 = 10, num2 = 16, num3 = 6 .

A variable is an abstraction inside a program that holds a value, where each variable has associated data storage that represents a single value at a time (However, if the value is a collection type such as a list, then the value can contain multiple values). | Variables typically have meaningful names that helps with the overall organization of the code and understanding of what is being represented by the variables | Some programming languages provide a variety of methods to represent data, which are referenced using variables 9Booleans, numbers, lists, and strings) | One form of a value is better suited for representation than antoher. | . What is a Variable? . A variable is an abstraction made inside a program that holds a value. These variables are used in code to refer to more comples values that the variable contains and makes the program code more organized and smoother to run. . Variables can be seen as &quot;containers&quot; and each container has a name that holds what it is supposed to hold. In the following code, we can see that a variable has the value of &quot;Alex.&quot; How can we make the variable appear more organized in the code? . x = &quot;alex&quot; print(x) . alex . Choosing Variables . When choosing variables, it is important to assign the variables name to something that correlates with what the function of the variable is supposed to do. For example, we do not want a variable that is supposed to hold a name be named &quot;age&quot; becaue it can be confusing and mistakes may be more prevalent. . Example: . age = &quot;Timmy&quot; name = &quot;25&quot; print(name + &quot; is &quot; + age) . 25 is Timmy . Notice how age is going to be seen when printing the code. That can lead to confusion | . Data Types . Variables have different data types that store specific kinds of data depending on what is being represented. Some examples are shown below: . integer (numbers) | string (or text/letters) | Boolean (True/False statements) | . These types of data types can be useful when trying to represent a value. For example, you would not want a variable meant to represent someone&#39;s name with an integer. . Questions (College Board&#39;s Essential Knowledge): . What exactly IS a variable? | What is the best data type to represent someone&#39;s dog&#39;s name? | Why is it important to give variables specific names before containing values? | What is the best way to represent someone&#39;s phone number? | Bonus (Not required but important to know): . How can we update a variable&#39;s value | What function is used to recieve a user&#39;s input? | Variables (3.1.2) - Noor . Learning objective for 3.1.2: . Determine the value of a variable as a result of an assignment . done through looking at how we can use the assignment operator | . Note: . Collegeboard uses &lt;-- as the assignment operator . The assignment operator looks different for different types of coding languages A variable will take the most recent value assigned | . How do you even store a value inside a variable? . Let&#39;s use python for our example: . In python, the assignment operator is the equal sign (=) | In order to store a value inside a variable, we must: Give the variable a name | place the assignment operator | input the variable value | . | . highscore = 100 # How do you store a number like 3.72? money = 3.72 # What about storing your username (string)? username = &quot;name&quot; # What if it is raining outside and you want to store that fact (boolean)? is_raining = True # What about a list of groceries? groceries = [&quot;eggs&quot;, &quot;flour&quot;, &quot;bread&quot;, &quot;milk&quot;] . Lets Look at an Example: . x = 10 y = 20 z = 30 x = y z = x # what do you think z will be? print(z) . 20 . Let&#39;s get a little more practical here . Imagine that you are making a calendar and have just finished the html code that is needed: . You now want to be able to switch between the months of the year by using the &quot;next&quot; or &quot;prev&quot; buttons you will need to take the html elements and use them to your advantage but how? | . | . | . &lt;body&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;calendar&quot;&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;month&quot;&gt; &lt;button class=&quot;prev&quot;&gt;Prev&lt;/button&gt; &lt;button class=&quot;next&quot;&gt;Next&lt;/button&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;script&gt; // to make our lives a little easier, we can store the div next and prev into variables // this way we don&#39;t need to type out as much // Note: You CAN just add the event listener to document.querySelector(.next) or prev and get the same desired outcome nextButton = document.querySelector(.next) prevButton = document.querySelector(.prev) // we can go make the buttons functional by adding an addeventlistner to them &lt;/script&gt; .

We learned what is a assignment operator | We learned how to use the assignment operator | We learned how to store a value inside a variable using the assignment operator | We experimented with a few examples | . Hacks: . Answer these: . In your own words, briefly explain by writing down what an assignment operator is | In Collegeboard pseudocode, what symbol is used to assign values to variables? | A variable, x, is initially given a value of 15. Later on, the value for x is changed to 22. If you print x, would the command display 15 or 22? | . An assignment operator is a symbol used to assign a value to a variable. For example = in python. . | An arrow to the left pointing from the value towards the variable it should be assigned to. . | The command would display 22, because variables are always the most recently assigned value. . | Hacks: . Copy the all the html code into a markdown file and run your local server. You will then see a decimal to binary converter near the html code. The problem is that it is not converting the decimal to binary. This is because the variables are not defined properly and it is your job to use the information learned today to fix the converter. Don&#39;t change the css . Bonus (optional): . There&#39;s more than one way to define the variable. List two ways to do it. . You can define a variable using a number. For example: x = 5. . | You can also assign a prexisting variable to a new one. For example: x = 5, then y = x. . | Rubric . For .15: .

Mangos . Data Abstraction with Lists - Steven . Data abstraction can be created with lists. . Lists bundle together multiple elements and/or variables under one name are not defined with specified lengths. | The variables that are stored in a list do not have to be limited to one kind of variable. | The user does not need to know how the list stores data (this gives way for data abstraction). | . In the code below, the logic itself works with a list, but the code abstracts it into a sequence of bits in a string (as seen in the input and output). To make this work, the splitbits lists is created and processed. At the end of the code, the result is outputted as a string rather than a list (abstraction). . bits = input(&quot;Input a sequence of bits to invert: &quot;) splitbits = list(bits) for i in range(len(splitbits)): if splitbits[i] == &#39;0&#39;: splitbits[i] = &#39;1&#39; elif splitbits[i] == &#39;1&#39;: splitbits[i] = &#39;0&#39; print(&quot;&quot;.join(splitbits)) . Hacks . The following code is incomplete. Its intended purpose is to increase three numbers, all of which ask for user input, by an amount specified the user. The input code is abstracted, but the actual logic isn&#39;t connected to the abstraction. | . num1=input(&quot;Input a number. &quot;) num2=input(&quot;Input a number. &quot;) num3=input(&quot;Input a number. &quot;) add=input(&quot;How much would you like to add? &quot;) # Add code in the space below # The following is the code that adds the inputted addend to the other numbers. It is hidden from the user. for i in numlist: numlist[i -1] += int(add) print(numlist) .

Managing Complexity with lists - Liav . Long and slow way . By now, everyone should know the &quot;long and slow way&quot; to print a list of something in python It is easy to just assign a value to a single variable | This method is displayed in this example with test scores: | . | . score1 = 95 score2 = 24 score3 = 87 score4 = 92 print(score1, score2, score3, score4) . As you can see, each score is assigned to its relative variable such as &quot;score1 = 95&quot; and then you just print each variable. | However you can make the code segment faster, easier to read, and more efficient... | . Assinging values to one variable . Use square brackets &quot;[]&quot; to store the values of a certain variable, then you can simply print the variable to output your desired list: | . scores = [95, 24, 87, 92] print(scores) . Now instead of having a difference variable and new line of code for each value, the list is simply displayed by assigning each value to a single value that you can now print. | . How lists manage complexity of a program . Simplification . It is much simpler, faster, and easier to code lists this way | Makes the code segment much easier to read | . | Variables . You do not need as many variables, because you can just assign all corresponding values to a single variable | To change a value you don&#39;t have to edit/add/remove an entire variable | . | .

I created this function which asks questions like a quiz about a list of dictionaries that is given to it. This will take the dictionaries created above and convert them into a series of questions. . def ask_questions(QDb): correct_cnt = 0 total_cnt = 0 for dict_item in QDb: person_name = dict_item[&#39;Firstname&#39;] for key in dict_item: if key == &#39;Firstname&#39;: continue else: question = &quot;what is &quot; + person_name + &quot;&#39;s &quot; + key correct_answer = dict_item[key] user_answer = input(question) if user_answer == &quot;exit&quot;: break total_cnt += 1 if correct_answer == user_answer: correct_cnt += 1 print(&quot;Your answer is correct&quot;) else: print(&quot;Your answer is incorrect&quot;) if user_answer == &quot;exit&quot;: print(&quot;Bye!&quot;) break print(&#39;you answered: &#39;, correct_cnt, &#39;/&#39;, total_cnt, &quot;Correct&quot;) ask_questions(QuizDb) . Your answer is correct Your answer is correct Your answer is correct Your answer is correct Your answer is correct Your answer is correct you answered: 6 / 6 . This is a simple while loop function that takes two integers that you give it, and inclusively lists all the integers in between them from least to greatest. The first integer must be less than the second integer. . def list_num_inclusive(x,y): x = int(x) y = int(y) if x &gt;= y: print(&quot;ERROR!!! Starting value must be less than ending value. Please try again.&quot;) else: print(&quot;Here are your numbers!!!&quot;) while x &lt;= y: print(x) x += 1 starting_value = input(&quot;What is the starting value? (Inclusive&quot;) ending_value = input(&quot;What is the ending value? (Inclusive&quot;) list_num_inclusive(starting_value, ending_value) . Here are your numbers!!! 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 . This is a function that uses a recursive loop, which means that when the function is defined, it calls for itself. This can create a loop that repeats itself until a specific condition is met. In this case takes a dictionary value and increments itself while adding itself to a sum. This creates a factorial like function, but for addition. For example if you input 1 into this function, it will take 1+2+3+4+5 = 15. . def example_recursive(x): x = int(x) if x &lt; 10: x += 1 x=example_recursive(x) else: print(&quot;End of recursive loop&quot;) return x def example_recursive_dict(dict_obj, NN): #dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;] = int(dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;]) print(&#39;inside example_recursive_dict, val is: &#39;,dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;]) if dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;] &lt; NN: dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;] += 1 dict_obj[&#39;sum&#39;] += dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;] #print(&#39;inside if&#39;) example_recursive_dict(dict_obj, NN) else: print(&quot;End of recursive loop&quot;) #recursive_var = input(&quot;What number should we start with?&quot;) #recursive_var=example_recursive(recursive_var) #print(recursive_var) def example_by_reference(dict_obj): dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;] += 1 dict_test = {&#39;val&#39;: 2, &#39;sum&#39;: 0} print(dict_test[&#39;val&#39;]) example_by_reference(dict_test) print(dict_test[&#39;val&#39;]) example_by_reference(dict_test) print(dict_test[&#39;val&#39;]) dict_test[&#39;val&#39;] = 0 dict_test[&#39;sum&#39;] = 0 example_recursive_dict(dict_test, 5) print(&#39;summation is done, value is: &#39;, dict_test[&#39;sum&#39;]) . 2 3 4 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 0 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 1 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 2 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 3 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 4 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 5 End of recursive loop summation is done, value is: 15 .",
