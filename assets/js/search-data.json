Set up your notebook by either wgetting the lesson or tracking it by your own (We would recommend wgetting since there are some fill in the blanks!) | wget here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmaxwu/Tri2-GroupFastpages/master/_notebooks/2022-12-dd-lesson.ipynb | . 3.17: Algorithm Efficiency . Purpose: . The purpose of this lesson is to help students understand how to make an efficient program and optimize it and understand its importance to the CSP curriculum. . What is Algorithmic Efficiency? . The ability of an algorithm to solve a problem in an efficient way An efficient algorithm solves a problem ___ and with a _, such as time and memory. | . | How do we determine if an algorithm is efficient or not? One way we can do this is by determining the _ of the algorithm. | Another way is through _. | . | . Traveling Merchant Problem Hacks: . What did you and your team discuss? (record below) . An __ solution is __ that produces a solution that isn&#39;t necessarily _ but can be used when normal methods take forever | . Describe the method used to solve the traveling merchant problem. (record below) . 3.18: Undecidable Problems . Purpose: . The purpose of this lesson is to introduce students to the concept of undecidable problems in computer science and to explain why these problems are important. . Key vocabulary: . Decision problem | Decidable problem | Undecidable problem | . Decision Problem . A decision problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics that can be solved by a yes-no answer, also known as a binary answer. In other words, a decision problem is a problem for which there are only two possible outputs:&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. There are two types of decision problems that Collegeboard goes over: . Decidable Problems | Undecidable Problems | . A __ is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which an algorithm can be created that can always produce a correct answer or solution. In other words, a decidable problem is a problem for which there exists an algorithm that can be used to determine whether a given input is a valid solution or not. . An __ problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which it is impossible to create an algorithm that can always provide a correct answer or solution. This means that it is not possible for an algorithm to always determine whether a given input is a valid solution to an undecidable problem. . Decidable Problems . A decidable problem is an algorithm that can always have an output of yes or no given any input. It is always correct. . Example of a Decidable Problem . The procedure below tests to see if a number is divisible by 13. If it is, it returns true. If it isn&#39;t, it returns false. . def divideThirteen(number): if number % 13 == 0: return True else: return False print(divideThirteen(26)) print(divideThirteen(30)) . True False . Undecidable Problems . An Example of a Forever Running Code . The code keeps adding 1 to the variable number until number is no longer an integer(This is not the python data type &quot;integer&quot;, it&#39;s the integer in number theory). However, there is no end to this code, making the computer run forever. There is no halt to the code. . i = 0 number = 1 def integerTest(n): # Testing if the number is an integer if n%1 ==0: return True else: return False # Using while loop to keep searching an a non-integer above 1. Note that the computer runs forever. while i == 0: number += 1 if integerTest(number) == False: i +=1 print(&quot;Done&quot;) . The Halting Problem . The halting problem is an example of an __. It states that it is not always possible to correctly determine whether a code halts or runs forever. . There is __ to write an algorithm to analyze and determine whether a body of code can run forever or not. . Halting Problem Example: . In order to understand this, suppose that an algorithm was able to analyze whether a code halts or not. Let&#39;s call this algorithm HaltChecker. | HaltChecker analyzes the program,program P, and its input,input I. If program P halts with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;halts&quot;. If program P doesn&#39;t halt(runs forever) with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;never&quot;. For example, in the code where it tests if variable number, the __, so HaltChecker returns an output of __. | Then, we add another algorithm called Reverser which reverses HaltChecker&#39;s output. So, if &quot;never&quot; is the output of HaltChecker, then the output of Reverser is __. It&#39;s also the same the other way around: if HaltChecker has an output of &quot;halts&quot;, then Reverser has an output of __. | We combine these algorithms into one entire body of code. | Since Reverser is the algorithm at the end, hence giving the ultimate output, notice how it prints &quot;never&quot; when in fact there is an end(As proved by HaltChecker), and how it also prints &quot;halts&quot; when there is in fact is no end to the code(Also proved by HaltChecker). As a result, HaltChecker is inaccurate and this is an undecidable problem. | . This Diagram Sums up the Entire Process in the Bulleted List: . Credits of diagram and example to Khan Academy . FAQ . Q: If Reverser is causing the problem, why not remove it? | A: Removing Reverser will remove the problems, however, we are looking for ways which create the problem of not outputting a correct result. One example is enough to prove that it is an undecidable problem since it proves that the code is not completely accurate. | . Extra Things to Notice . Note that while a computer may take a long time to run a section of code, it does not mean that the computer is going to run forever. | Humans are able to solve some undecidable problems. The entire Halting Problem example was to prove that computers cannot solve undecidable problems. | . Hacks . Come up with one situation in which a computer runs into an undecidable problem. Explain why it is considered an undecidable problem. . 3.17 Homework . Your homework for Algorithmic Efficiency is pretty simple. .

This can create a loop that repeats itself until a specific condition is met. In this case takes a dictionary value and increments itself while adding itself to a sum. This creates a factorial like function, but for addition. For example if you input 1 into this function, it will take 1+2+3+4+5 = 15. . def example_recursive(x): x = int(x) if x &lt; 10: x += 1 x=example_recursive(x) else: print(&quot;End of recursive loop&quot;) return x def example_recursive_dict(dict_obj, NN): #dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;] = int(dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;]) print(&#39;inside example_recursive_dict, val is: &#39;,dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;]) if dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;] &lt; NN: dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;] += 1 dict_obj[&#39;sum&#39;] += dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;] #print(&#39;inside if&#39;) example_recursive_dict(dict_obj, NN) else: print(&quot;End of recursive loop&quot;) #recursive_var = input(&quot;What number should we start with?&quot;) #recursive_var=example_recursive(recursive_var) #print(recursive_var) def example_by_reference(dict_obj): dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;] += 1 dict_test = {&#39;val&#39;: 2, &#39;sum&#39;: 0} print(dict_test[&#39;val&#39;]) example_by_reference(dict_test) print(dict_test[&#39;val&#39;]) example_by_reference(dict_test) print(dict_test[&#39;val&#39;]) dict_test[&#39;val&#39;] = 0 dict_test[&#39;sum&#39;] = 0 example_recursive_dict(dict_test, 5) print(&#39;summation is done, value is: &#39;, dict_test[&#39;sum&#39;]) . 2 3 4 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 0 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 1 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 2 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 3 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 4 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 5 End of recursive loop summation is done, value is: 15 .",

Purpose: . The purpose of this lesson is to help students understand how to make an efficient program and optimize it and understand its importance to the CSP curriculum. . What is Algorithmic Efficiency? . The ability of an algorithm to solve a problem in an efficient way An efficient algorithm solves a problem ___ and with a _, such as time and memory. | . | How do we determine if an algorithm is efficient or not? One way we can do this is by determining the _ of the algorithm. | Another way is through _. | . | . Traveling Merchant Problem Hacks: . What did you and your team discuss? (record below) . An __ solution is __ that produces a solution that isn&#39;t necessarily _ but can be used when normal methods take forever | . Describe the method used to solve the traveling merchant problem. (record below) . 3.18: Undecidable Problems . Purpose: . The purpose of this lesson is to introduce students to the concept of undecidable problems in computer science and to explain why these problems are important. . Key vocabulary: . Decision problem | Decidable problem | Undecidable problem | . Decision Problem . A decision problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics that can be solved by a yes-no answer, also known as a binary answer. In other words, a decision problem is a problem for which there are only two possible outputs:&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. There are two types of decision problems that Collegeboard goes over: . Decidable Problems | Undecidable Problems | . A __ is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which an algorithm can be created that can always produce a correct answer or solution. In other words, a decidable problem is a problem for which there exists an algorithm that can be used to determine whether a given input is a valid solution or not. . An __ problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which it is impossible to create an algorithm that can always provide a correct answer or solution. This means that it is not possible for an algorithm to always determine whether a given input is a valid solution to an undecidable problem. . Decidable Problems . A decidable problem is an algorithm that can always have an output of yes or no given any input. It is always correct. . Example of a Decidable Problem . The procedure below tests to see if a number is divisible by 13. If it is, it returns true. If it isn&#39;t, it returns false. . def divideThirteen(number): if number % 13 == 0: return True else: return False print(divideThirteen(26)) print(divideThirteen(30)) . True False . Undecidable Problems . An Example of a Forever Running Code . The code keeps adding 1 to the variable number until number is no longer an integer(This is not the python data type &quot;integer&quot;, it&#39;s the integer in number theory). However, there is no end to this code, making the computer run forever. There is no halt to the code. . i = 0 number = 1 def integerTest(n): # Testing if the number is an integer if n%1 ==0: return True else: return False # Using while loop to keep searching an a non-integer above 1. Note that the computer runs forever. while i == 0: number += 1 if integerTest(number) == False: i +=1 print(&quot;Done&quot;) . The Halting Problem . The halting problem is an example of an __. It states that it is not always possible to correctly determine whether a code halts or runs forever. . There is __ to write an algorithm to analyze and determine whether a body of code can run forever or not. . Halting Problem Example: . In order to understand this, suppose that an algorithm was able to analyze whether a code halts or not. Let&#39;s call this algorithm HaltChecker. | HaltChecker analyzes the program,program P, and its input,input I. If program P halts with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;halts&quot;. If program P doesn&#39;t halt(runs forever) with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;never&quot;. For example, in the code where it tests if variable number, the __, so HaltChecker returns an output of __. | Then, we add another algorithm called Reverser which reverses HaltChecker&#39;s output. So, if &quot;never&quot; is the output of HaltChecker, then the output of Reverser is __. It&#39;s also the same the other way around: if HaltChecker has an output of &quot;halts&quot;, then Reverser has an output of __. | We combine these algorithms into one entire body of code. | Since Reverser is the algorithm at the end, hence giving the ultimate output, notice how it prints &quot;never&quot; when in fact there is an end(As proved by HaltChecker), and how it also prints &quot;halts&quot; when there is in fact is no end to the code(Also proved by HaltChecker). As a result, HaltChecker is inaccurate and this is an undecidable problem. | . This Diagram Sums up the Entire Process in the Bulleted List: . Credits of diagram and example to Khan Academy . FAQ . Q: If Reverser is causing the problem, why not remove it? | A: Removing Reverser will remove the problems, however, we are looking for ways which create the problem of not outputting a correct result. One example is enough to prove that it is an undecidable problem since it proves that the code is not completely accurate. | . Extra Things to Notice . Note that while a computer may take a long time to run a section of code, it does not mean that the computer is going to run forever. | Humans are able to solve some undecidable problems. The entire Halting Problem example was to prove that computers cannot solve undecidable problems. | . Hacks . Come up with one situation in which a computer runs into an undecidable problem. Explain why it is considered an undecidable problem. . 3.17 Homework . Your homework for Algorithmic Efficiency is pretty simple. .

This will take the dictionaries created above and convert them into a series of questions. . def ask_questions(QDb): correct_cnt = 0 total_cnt = 0 for dict_item in QDb: person_name = dict_item[&#39;Firstname&#39;] for key in dict_item: if key == &#39;Firstname&#39;: continue else: question = &quot;what is &quot; + person_name + &quot;&#39;s &quot; + key correct_answer = dict_item[key] user_answer = input(question) if user_answer == &quot;exit&quot;: break total_cnt += 1 if correct_answer == user_answer: correct_cnt += 1 print(&quot;Your answer is correct&quot;) else: print(&quot;Your answer is incorrect&quot;) if user_answer == &quot;exit&quot;: print(&quot;Bye!&quot;) break print(&#39;you answered: &#39;, correct_cnt, &#39;/&#39;, total_cnt, &quot;Correct&quot;) ask_questions(QuizDb) . Your answer is correct Your answer is correct Your answer is correct Your answer is correct Your answer is correct Your answer is correct you answered: 6 / 6 . This is a simple while loop function that takes two integers that you give it, and inclusively lists all the integers in between them from least to greatest. The first integer must be less than the second integer. . def list_num_inclusive(x,y): x = int(x) y = int(y) if x &gt;= y: print(&quot;ERROR!!! Starting value must be less than ending value. Please try again.&quot;) else: print(&quot;Here are your numbers!!!&quot;) while x &lt;= y: print(x) x += 1 starting_value = input(&quot;What is the starting value? (Inclusive&quot;) ending_value = input(&quot;What is the ending value? (Inclusive&quot;) list_num_inclusive(starting_value, ending_value) . Here are your numbers!!! 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 . This is a function that uses a recursive loop, which means that when the function is defined, it calls for itself. This can create a loop that repeats itself until a specific condition is met. In this case takes a dictionary value and increments itself while adding itself to a sum. This creates a factorial like function, but for addition. For example if you input 1 into this function, it will take 1+2+3+4+5 = 15. . def example_recursive(x): x = int(x) if x &lt; 10: x += 1 x=example_recursive(x) else: print(&quot;End of recursive loop&quot;) return x def example_recursive_dict(dict_obj, NN): #dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;] = int(dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;]) print(&#39;inside example_recursive_dict, val is: &#39;,dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;]) if dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;] &lt; NN: dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;] += 1 dict_obj[&#39;sum&#39;] += dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;] #print(&#39;inside if&#39;) example_recursive_dict(dict_obj, NN) else: print(&quot;End of recursive loop&quot;) #recursive_var = input(&quot;What number should we start with?&quot;) #recursive_var=example_recursive(recursive_var) #print(recursive_var) def example_by_reference(dict_obj): dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;] += 1 dict_test = {&#39;val&#39;: 2, &#39;sum&#39;: 0} print(dict_test[&#39;val&#39;]) example_by_reference(dict_test) print(dict_test[&#39;val&#39;]) example_by_reference(dict_test) print(dict_test[&#39;val&#39;]) dict_test[&#39;val&#39;] = 0 dict_test[&#39;sum&#39;] = 0 example_recursive_dict(dict_test, 5) print(&#39;summation is done, value is: &#39;, dict_test[&#39;sum&#39;]) . 2 3 4 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 0 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 1 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 2 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 3 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 4 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 5 End of recursive loop summation is done, value is: 15 .",

            "content": "There are many ethical and legal concerns when coming up with ideas and patents in the software world. There are many different licenses that offer different benefits and uses, such as GPL, and MIT licenses. . Using the General Public Licensing (GPL) can result in you losing your rights to charge for software and patents, as it renders your work as derivative and free open source code. This license allows other to do anything to and with your code except distribute closed source versions of it. Using this license will require your Github project to be public. This is mainly used to write and distribute code that others can use and adapt. . | Another license, the MIT license, is useful to companies such as Qualcomm, because it allows you to use code freely, and make and distribute closed source versions of the code. However, the author of the software or code usually wants credit so you might need to add their name in the comments. This will allow you to make your github project private. This is usually used for writing software that you want credit and expect to get paid for. . | . The license that Github Fastpages asked for when we first made it had a private and public key. My repository is private, and because I don&#39;t need to have credits or any legal rights over my code, and it is in a public repository, it uses the Apache License 2.0 which gives you control and usability, but you can&#39;t get trademarks or similar legal rights over the repository. This is commonly used for academic purposes. . PII is Personal Identifiable Information. This includes anything from your name to your email, password, and even your social security number. You can end up in a terrible situation if you are not careful with what information you provide where. . Certain information that is known or can be accessed by anyone: Name, Email (suggest a junk email), Picture, High School attended, College Attended, Properties you own, State-City of residence, all State-City of previous residence, Credit Reports . | Other information is iffy, and may be known or accessed by some people. For good measure you should strive to keep this information secure and private: Birth date, Place of Birth, Street Address, Phone Number, Maiden names of Mother and Grandmother, Drivers License Number . | The final category of information is completely private and secret information that should never be shared unless absolutely necessary and is directed toward a trusted group or person: Credentials for Access, Two-Factor Authentication on Financial accounts, Social Security Number, Tax records . | . There are many different malicious viruses, frauds, scams, and other dangerous activities that can be a severe issue if you are not careful. They will try to steal your private PII with intent to sell it, use it, or even at time commit complete identity theft or fraud. Here are some examples of these malicious activities. . Malware: This is any type of software or program that you download that is malicious and has bad intentions. They make your life much worse so try to avoid these. . | Viruses: A type of malware, specifically a program that damages your system while putting your information at risk. They usually slow down your computer and are very annoying. Can get protection from this by getting an antivirus and being careful with what you download. Make sure to get a good antivirus, or it may end up being a virus itself. . | Phishing: This is a method of getting a virus onto your machine. These usually have promises of lots of money on them, and all you have to do is click the link to get rich. The only thing you are really getting is a virus. . | Use two factor authentication and be careful with links and downloads in order to be safe while browsing the internet. Two factor authentication is a great way of adding an extra layer of protection and security to your accounts and the information stored on them. . | . I have seen my name, username, slack account, and github account all used in the CSP class. . | I feel like I have a good understanding of PIIs, but sadly I am pretty sure I have already leaked lots my information. Earlier, when I was younger, I did not understand cybersecurity, and the risks of browsing the internet. I would click random links and download things without checking them. Its not wonder all the computers I used before 5 years ago all slowed down to a crawl and were unusable. Since learning about the risks of PIIs, I am making sure to keep my information private and secure. . | A good password is a unique, creative, and abstract password that is not easy to guess or figure out, and will take a long time to crack with brute force. These good passwords include many lowercase and capital letters, along with numerous symbols, numbers and other characters that make cracking the password nearly impossible. The longer the password the better. Bad passwords are passwords that are easy to figure out or crack. Some examples are &quot;1234&quot;, and &quot;password&quot;. If you choose good secure passwords, it makes it much harder for someone to hack your accounts and get access to your PIIs. . | Symmetric encryption is when a value or string is encrypted and decrypted using only one secret private key. Asymmetric encryption is when a value or string is encrypted and decrypted using two keys. One public and one private. SSL uses both methods of encryption. . | I think we encrypted all of our server names, as they usually had really long ids. We make sure that all of our servers that were running on AWS could only be accessed by certain users who were whitelisted and had the correct keys. . | I learned about a scheme the hard way when I was around 9. There was a movie that I really wanted to watch, but It was still in theaters, and my parents probably would have said no if I asked them to take me to see it. I saw an ad that was advertising the movie in its entirety, and so out of excitement I clicked on it. This then prompted me to download some type of google chrome extension, and it was probably a virus. When my dad found out about this, he told me what had happened, and taught me about how these things work, and how important it is to be discrete and careful when using the internet. . |",

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure). An Object is used like many other Python variables. | A Class has ... a collection of data, these are called Attributes and in Python are pre-fixed using the keyword self | a collection of Functions/Procedures. These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template.

This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

One way we can do this is by determining the _ of the algorithm. | Another way is through _. | . | . Traveling Merchant Problem Hacks: . What did you and your team discuss? (record below) . An __ solution is __ that produces a solution that isn&#39;t necessarily _ but can be used when normal methods take forever | . Describe the method used to solve the traveling merchant problem. (record below) . 3.18: Undecidable Problems . Purpose: . The purpose of this lesson is to introduce students to the concept of undecidable problems in computer science and to explain why these problems are important. . Key vocabulary: . Decision problem | Decidable problem | Undecidable problem | . Decision Problem . A decision problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics that can be solved by a yes-no answer, also known as a binary answer. In other words, a decision problem is a problem for which there are only two possible outputs:&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. There are two types of decision problems that Collegeboard goes over: . Decidable Problems | Undecidable Problems | . A __ is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which an algorithm can be created that can always produce a correct answer or solution. In other words, a decidable problem is a problem for which there exists an algorithm that can be used to determine whether a given input is a valid solution or not. . An __ problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which it is impossible to create an algorithm that can always provide a correct answer or solution. This means that it is not possible for an algorithm to always determine whether a given input is a valid solution to an undecidable problem. . Decidable Problems . A decidable problem is an algorithm that can always have an output of yes or no given any input. It is always correct. . Example of a Decidable Problem . The procedure below tests to see if a number is divisible by 13. If it is, it returns true. If it isn&#39;t, it returns false. . def divideThirteen(number): if number % 13 == 0: return True else: return False print(divideThirteen(26)) print(divideThirteen(30)) . True False . Undecidable Problems . An Example of a Forever Running Code . The code keeps adding 1 to the variable number until number is no longer an integer(This is not the python data type &quot;integer&quot;, it&#39;s the integer in number theory). However, there is no end to this code, making the computer run forever. There is no halt to the code. . i = 0 number = 1 def integerTest(n): # Testing if the number is an integer if n%1 ==0: return True else: return False # Using while loop to keep searching an a non-integer above 1. Note that the computer runs forever. while i == 0: number += 1 if integerTest(number) == False: i +=1 print(&quot;Done&quot;) . The Halting Problem . The halting problem is an example of an __. It states that it is not always possible to correctly determine whether a code halts or runs forever. . There is __ to write an algorithm to analyze and determine whether a body of code can run forever or not. . Halting Problem Example: . In order to understand this, suppose that an algorithm was able to analyze whether a code halts or not. Let&#39;s call this algorithm HaltChecker. | HaltChecker analyzes the program,program P, and its input,input I. If program P halts with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;halts&quot;. If program P doesn&#39;t halt(runs forever) with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;never&quot;. For example, in the code where it tests if variable number, the __, so HaltChecker returns an output of __. | Then, we add another algorithm called Reverser which reverses HaltChecker&#39;s output. So, if &quot;never&quot; is the output of HaltChecker, then the output of Reverser is __. It&#39;s also the same the other way around: if HaltChecker has an output of &quot;halts&quot;, then Reverser has an output of __. | We combine these algorithms into one entire body of code. | Since Reverser is the algorithm at the end, hence giving the ultimate output, notice how it prints &quot;never&quot; when in fact there is an end(As proved by HaltChecker), and how it also prints &quot;halts&quot; when there is in fact is no end to the code(Also proved by HaltChecker). As a result, HaltChecker is inaccurate and this is an undecidable problem. | . This Diagram Sums up the Entire Process in the Bulleted List: . Credits of diagram and example to Khan Academy . FAQ . Q: If Reverser is causing the problem, why not remove it? | A: Removing Reverser will remove the problems, however, we are looking for ways which create the problem of not outputting a correct result. One example is enough to prove that it is an undecidable problem since it proves that the code is not completely accurate. | . Extra Things to Notice . Note that while a computer may take a long time to run a section of code, it does not mean that the computer is going to run forever. | Humans are able to solve some undecidable problems. The entire Halting Problem example was to prove that computers cannot solve undecidable problems. | . Hacks . Come up with one situation in which a computer runs into an undecidable problem. Explain why it is considered an undecidable problem. . 3.17 Homework . Your homework for Algorithmic Efficiency is pretty simple. .

Given a height and a weight, they calculate how long it will take for a object to fall to the ground in a vacuum subjected to normal Earth levels of gravity. . However, the second one is a simulation. It calculates the distance the object has fallen every 0.1 seconds. This is useful for if you wanted a visual representation of a falling object, which pure math can&#39;t do as smoothly. . height = float(input(&quot;height in meters?&quot;)) weight = input(&quot;weight in pounds?&quot;) stuff = (2 * (height / 9.8))**(1/2) print(&quot;It will take&quot;, stuff,&quot;seconds for an object that weighs&quot;,weight,&quot;pounds&quot;,&quot;to fall &quot;,height,&quot;meters in a vacuum&quot;) . t = 0 g = 0 d = 0 false = True while false: t = t + 0.1 d = 9.8 / 2 * (t**2) if d &gt;= height: false = False #print(d) # if you want to print the distance every time it calculates it.

            "content": "Calling Procedures . Slide 1: . A procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values. | Procedures are referred to by different names, such as method or function, depending on the programing language. | Parameters are input values of a procedure. Arguments specify the values of the parameters when procedure is called. | A procedure call interrupts the sequential execution of statements causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. One the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow or control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was called. | . Slide 2: . When calling procedures, it&#39;s important to take notice to whether it returns data, or a block of statements. | If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and inputting the arguments. | If the procedure returns some sort of data like a boolean or value, then you will assign that value to a variable | .

Developing Procedures . Slide 8: . Picking a descriptive name is important in case you revisit the code later on (separate words with capitals) There are 2 different types of procedures- ones that return a value and those that simply execute a block of statements Steps of developing procedure: picking a useful name, thinking of parameters (what data does the procedure need to know), making a flowchart or writing procedure in pseudocode, and actually developing the procedure. .

Procedural Abstraction . One type of abstraction is procedural abstraction which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does and not how it does it | This is very helpful in managing complexity in a program | Subdivision of a program into separate subprograms is called modularity | A procedural abstraction may extract shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code. This allows for program reuse, which helps manage complexity | When a pre-written procedure is called, you don’t necessarily need to know the details of this, just what it does and how to call it | Simply, procedural abstraction is naming and calling a prewritten procedure | Making sure to include the right arguments so the procedure can do what its supposed to do is crucial | .

Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks . | Algorithms that appear similar can yield different side effects or results. . | Some conditional statements can be written as the same as Boolean expressions (VICE VERSA) . | Different algorithms can be developed or use to solve the same problem. . | . Example 1 | What happens if we test the algorithm with different outputs? . The pseudocode above is translated to python for you. . Record what your outputs are when you enter 95 degrees F, does the algorithm yield the same result? . The conditional below is nested . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) else: if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) else: print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then 95, what do you notice? . It is too cold outside! . temp = int(input(&quot;Select a temperature from 0 to 99 degrees F&quot;)) if (temp &gt;= 90): print(&quot;It&#39;s too hot outside!&quot;) if (temp &gt;= 65): print(&quot;Sure I will play outside!&quot;) if (temp &lt; 65): print(&quot;It is too cold outside!&quot;) # Input 54 and then Input 95, what do you notice? . It is too cold outside! . NOW RECORD with another output . Record what your outputs are when you enter 54, does the algorithm yield the same result this time? . *Now use 95 as an input for the two code blocks above. . Even though an algorithm&#39;s code can look the same, you have to be careful, they can always yield different results. When constructing algorithms you want to make sure that your code corresponds with what you want as your output. You set the limit of your code and you decide what the code&#39;s output is. . Conditionals vs. Booleans . The condition and instructions are what differ, that&#39;s where the magic happens. The condition is a boolean expression when an expression outputs either true or false. Boolean values are another type of data type in programming languages, and they can only ever hold true or false. . Exercise . Learning how to utilize conditionals and booleans are important for developing algorithms. Use this exercise to help you. . Can either Boolean expression on the right replace the conditional on the left? Assume isWeekday and isHoliday are Boolean variables. . *NOTE = you can edit the variables to check the conditions needed! . IsHoliday = False IsWeekday = True if IsHoliday: driveWork = True else: if IsWeekday: driveWork = True else: driveWork = False print(driveWork) . True . Logically thinking about conditionals and booleans . Now the problem may seem confusing, but the best way to develop an algorithm is to think about all the possible results that can be potentially be outputted. . So if IsHoliday is set to true, then driveWork is automatically equal to false and it does not matter what value of isWeekday is. This must mean that one of the conditionals must be NOT IsHoliday. . In the case that lets say IsHoliday is set to false, then the variable for weekday needs to be checked. If it&#39;s true then driveWork is true, if it&#39;s false then driveWork is false. This must mean that the other conditional isWeekday. . Combining both conditionals, you get option 2, which is not IsHoliday and IsWeekday. This is why option 2 is right! . Example 3 | Conditionals vs Booleans . The following algorithms are intended to sum the odd numbers from 1-9. Which algorithms work as intended? . Below, I have translated the block code into python, import this to your jupyter notebook and record the result. What do you notice? . First block . sum = 1 counter = 3 for x in range(4): print(&quot;Hi&quot;) . Hi Hi Hi Hi . sum = 1 counter = 3 #iteration var = 0 while (var &lt; 4): #while the var is &lt;= 4, it executes those commands, once it exceeds it hits the else command sum = sum + counter counter = counter + 2 var = var + 1 # now go through the whole thing 4 times, this is an iteration, a vital part of algorithms. else: print(sum) . 25 . Second block . sum = 0 counter = 9 #iteration while (counter &gt;= 1): sum = sum + counter counter = counter - 2 print(sum) . 25 . When we start our initializing left sum as 1 counter as 3 we had no iterations yet. Remember we&#39;re going to have to repeat this four times because the block code prompts us to repeat 4 times, so we iterate. So as we go through and follow what the block gives us. . So you see that the sum does work, it does sum up the odd numbers from 1-9 . Now lets look at the right block. . Sum is set to 0 Counter is set to 9 We must repeat until the counter &lt; 1 is true. . So we keep adding until -1, that is when the counter &lt; 1 is true, so we stop . So why is it important to understand that algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same task? . An algorithm is beautiful that way, just because you think of solving a problem differently, doesn&#39;t mean your wrong, . 3.9 Part 2 . Flowcharts . Flowcharts can help you visualize the functionality of an algorithm . | They are a good way to double check whether or not your algorithm is achieving its purpose . | . How To Set Up A Flowchart . label the start point . | Define any and all variables you may need . | Consider the first question you want the algorithm to ask . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is yes (or true) . | Write what you want the algorithm to do if the answer to that question is no (or false) . Steps 3-5 are the steps to creating code that uses a process called selection (you can convert the question from step 3 to a conditional if-statement in code) | . | Write out all necessary steps for the algorithm to function properly . | You may want your algorithm to iterate some steps until a condition is met . You can write the steps that need to be repeated, then draw an arrow from the last step to a step above that contains a conditional statement | . | determine a way to reach the end goal | Selection vs. Iteration . Selection: . A process used in algorithms where a conditional if-statement leads to one of two outcomes . Outcome 1: if the conditional statement is true, something will happen . | Outcome 2: if the conditional statement is false, something else will happen . | Ex: see Example A . | . | . | Iteration . A process used in algorithms that allows certain things to happen until a condition is satisfied . Once the condition is satisfied, then an outcome is produced . | This can take the form of a for-loop, while-loop, and/or if-statement . | . | . | . Example A . Consider this situation: . You are shopping for your favorite food at your favorite supermarket . | You see that there is a sale on wheat products for 35% off . | There is another sale on produce for 20% off . | These sales are mutually exclusive . | Tax on all items is 8% . | . | Your TASK: . Create a flowchart for an algorithm that can be used to calculate the cost of your favorite item | . | . Example A Possible Solution (using Selection) . 3.9 Part 3 . For Algorithms How to combine and/or modify an existing algorithm. | . | . Benefits of combining algorithms can reduce development time, testing time, and simplify the identification of errors. | . | . Example in Class . Rules . step/rule 1: start with any positive integer | step/rule 2: if the preceding term is even; divide by 2 | step/rule 3: if the preceding term is odd; multiply by 3 and add 1 | step/rule 4: repeat steps until you arrive at 1 | fact: the sequence should ALWAYS end up at 1 if repeated. | . Algorithm to Start (Determining Whether a Number is Even or Odd) . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) if (varx %2 == 0): varx == varx/2 # Change print to the function else: varx == varx * 3 + 1 # Change print to the function print(varx) # Run this cell to see how it works . choose value for x 4 .

Step 2 . step/rule 4; here we add the loop | . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) while varx != 1: if (varx %2 == 0): varx = varx/2 # Change print to the function else: varx = varx * 3 + 1 # Change print to the function print(varx) . choose value for x 1.0 . Step 3 . Display all values throughout the algorithm | . print(&quot;choose value for x&quot;) varx=int(input(&quot;Enter any positive Integer&quot;)) print(varx) while varx != 1: if (varx %2 == 0): varx = varx/2 print(varx) # add Display else: varx = varx * 3 + 1 print(varx) # add Display print(varx) # Final # Should be 1 every time . choose value for x 4 2.0 1.0 1.0 . Takeaways . You can use code you&#39;ve previously wrote in order to make a project easier. | Breaking algorithms down into steps can make things easier and more simple. | . Hacks . create another algorithm using a famous mathematical algorithm such as the &quot;collatz conjecture.&quot; and explain your steps in a post on a blog. | . def assignment_due(assignment_list): # This is a function that checks the due date in hours for assignment in assignment_list: if assignment[1] &lt; 24: # This checks if the hours left are less than 24 print(assignment[0]) # If the hours are less than 24 it will print the name of the assignment. assignment_list = [[&quot;assignment1&quot;, 12], [&quot;assignment2&quot;, 24], [&quot;assignment3&quot;, 48]] # This is a list of assignemnts and their corresponding due times. assignment_due(assignment_list) # This calls the function with the input of the list &quot;assignment_list&quot; . assignment1 . The steps of this function are as following: . I created a function that looks in a list of assignemnts and their corresponding due dates in hours left. . | The second step is to check if the number of hours left is less than 24. . | If it is less than 24, then the code should print the name of that assignment. . | Finally I called this function with the input of the &quot;assignment_list&quot; list. . | The code outputs assignment 1, because that is the only assignment that is due withing the next 24 hours. . | 3.11 Binary Search . Goals/Objectives: . detirmine number of iterations required to find vlue in data set. | explain requirements for binary search | . What is Binary Search? . Binary search is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. | An algorithm for iterating to find a value inside a data set | . About Binary Search: . Binary Search Algorithm starts in the middle of a data set of numbers and eliminates half the data. This process reapeats until the desired value is found or until all elements have been eliminated. | In order to use binary search effectivly and properly, data must be stored in order | COLLEGE BOARD INDEX STARTS AT 1 NOT 0 | . Think about how you would you would try to find a certain number in this set. . One way would be to line up the numbers and count them individually untill you find the desired value. . When working with large data sets with lots of numbers, methods like these wont work . Instead, a Binary Search would be more effective. | . Here we can see the numbers are set in an increasing order. Setting numbers in an increasing or decreasing is needed for a binary search . Binary search is started with the middle number first Middle number is found by taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two | . | Binary Search can be represented using a tree as shown below | . . Heres an easy way to put it: . binary search fidns the desired element by continuously chopping the search area in half | say the element you are looking for is &#39;f&#39; | . [a b c d e f g h] . We would start in the middle at element &#39;d&#39; | becuase our target is greater than d we will eliminate everything left of &#39;d&#39; including &#39;d&#39; (chopping it in half) . [e f g h] is what now remains . again we would &#39;chop in half&#39; | say we iterate through &#39;g&#39; and &#39;h&#39;, our desired element is still not found so we would eliminate &#39;g; and &#39;h&#39; and continue the process | . [e f] . now we are down to 2 elements | &#39;chopping in half&#39; will give us our desired element | . [f] . | . def BinarySearch(array, x, low, high): # Repeat until the pointers low and high meet each other while low &lt;= high: mid = low + (high - low)//2 # find the middle (taking the higest index number plus the lowest and divided by two) if array[mid] == x: # if desired number is the middle is found return desired number (middle number) return mid elif array[mid] &lt; x: low = mid + 1 else: high = mid - 1 return -1 array = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] x = 4 result = BinarySearch(array, x, 0, len(array)-1) if result != -1: print(&quot;Element is present at index &quot; + str(result)) else: print(&quot;Not found&quot;) . Element is present at index 1 . We have created a function called binary_search() function which takes two arguments - a list to be sorted and a number to be searched. . | We have declared two variables to store the lowest and highest values in the list. The lowest is assigned initial value to 0, the highest to len(list1) 1 and mid as 0. . | Next, we have declared the while loop with the condition that the lowest is equal and smaller than the highest. The while loop will iterate if the number has not been found yet. . | In the while loop, we find the mid value and compare the index value to the number we are searching for. . | If the value of the mid-index is smaller than n, we increase the mid value by 1 and assign it to the low. The search moves to the left side. . | Otherwise, if the value of mid index is larger than n, we decrease the mid value by 1 and assign it to the high. The search moves to the right side. . | If the n is equal to the mid value then return mid. . | This will happen until the low is equal and smaller than the high. . | If we reach at the end of the function, then the element is not present in the list. We return -1 to the calling function. . | . . Hacks . Using my example above and steps below, create your own iteration using binary search . Steps . Compare x with the middle element. | If x matches with the middle element, we return the mid index. | Else if x is greater than the mid element, then x can only lie in the right (greater) half subarray after the mid element. Then we apply the algorithm again for the right half. | Else if x is smaller, the target x must lie in the left (lower) half. So we apply the algorithm for the left half. | .

Coding all of these individually takes a lot of unnecessary time, how can we shorten this time? . Iteration . Iteration is the repetition of a process or utterance applied to the result or taken from a previous statement. There&#39;s a lot of types of iteration though, what to use? How do we apply iteration to lists? . Some methods include using a &quot;for loop&quot;, using a &quot;for loop and range()&quot;, using a &quot;while loop&quot;, and using comprehension . Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are iterable objects. They are the &#39;containers&#39; that store the data to iterate. . Each of these containers are able to iterate with the iter() command. . There are 2 types of iteration:definite and indefinite. Definite iteration clarifies how many times the loop is going to run, while indefinite specifies a condition that must be met . num_list = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] for variable in num_list: print(variable) . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 . Iterator? Iterable? Iteration? . When an object is iterable it can be used in an iteration | When passed through the function iter() it returns an iterator | Strings, lists, dictionaries, sets and tuples are all examples of iterable objects. | . a = [&#39;alpha&#39;, &#39;bravo&#39;, &#39;charlie&#39;] itr = iter(a) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) print(next(itr)) . alpha bravo charlie .

A 2D array is simply just a list of lists. The example below is technically correct but... . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Conventially 2D arrays are written like below. This is because 2D arrays are meant to be read in 2 dimensions (hence the name). Writing them like below makes them easier to visualize and understand. . keypad = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [&quot; &quot;, 0, &quot; &quot;]] . Printing a 2D Array . We already know that we can&#39;t just print the matrix by calling it. We need to iterate through it to print it. . def print_matrix1(matrix): for i in range(len(matrix)): # outer for loop. This runs on i which represents the row. range(len(matrix)) is in order to iterate through the length of the matrix for j in range(len(matrix[i])): # inner for loop. This runs on the length of the i&#39;th row in the matrix (j changes for each row with a different length) print(matrix[i][j], end=&quot; &quot;) # [i][j] is the 2D location of that value in the matrix, kinda like a coordinate pair. [i] iterates to the specific row and [j] iterates to the specific value in the row. end=&quot; &quot; changes the end value to space, not a new line. print() # prints extra line. this is in the outer loop, not the inner loop, because it only wants to print a new line for each row . print(&quot;Raw matrix (list of lists): &quot;) print(keypad) print(&quot;Matrix printed using nested for loop iteration:&quot;) print_matrix1(keypad) print() .

My birthday is Febuary 20 . Challenge . Change all of the letters that you DIDN&#39;T print above to spaces, &quot; &quot;, and then print the full keyboard. (the things you did print should remain in the same spot) . Alternative Challenge: If you would prefer, animate it using some form of delay so it flashes one of your letters at a time on the board in order and repeats. (this one may be slightly more intuitive) . DO NOT HARD CODE THIS. Don&#39;t make it harder on yourself, iterate through, make it abstract so it can be used dynamically. You should be able to input any string and your code should work. . . If you get stuck you can just make a picture with an array and print it (I will grade based on how good it looks) . I do expect an attempt so write some code to show you tried the challenge. .",

For example = in python. . | An arrow to the left pointing from the value towards the variable it should be assigned to. . | The command would display 22, because variables are always the most recently assigned value. . | There&#39;s more than one way to define the variable. List two ways to do it. | . You can define a variable using a number. For example: x = 5. . | You can also assign a prexisting variable to a new one. For example: x = 5, then y = x. . | What is a list? . | What is an element . | What is an easy way to reference the elements in a list or string? . | What is an example of a string? . | . A list is a sequence of elements with each element being a variable. . | An element is a part of a list, and can be accessed using indexes. . | An easy way to reference the elements in a list or string is using indexes, which select an element in respect to their order in the list or string. . | An example of a string is &quot;You can put literally anything inside of quotation marks.&quot; . |",

A library is a collection of precompiled codes that can be used later on in a program for some specific well-defined operations. | These precompiled codes can be referred to as modules. Each module contains bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs. | A library may also contain documentation, configuration data, message templates, classes, and values, etc. | . Why are libraries important? . Using Libraries makes Python Programming simpler and convenient for the programmer. | One example would be through looping and iteration, as we don’t need to write the same code again and again for different programs. | Python libraries play a very vital role in fields of Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Visualization, etc. | . A few libraries that simplify coding processes: . Pillow allows you to work with images. | Tensor Flow helps with data automation and monitors performance. | Matplotlib allows you to make 2D graphs and plots. | . The AP Exam Refrence Sheet itself is a library! . Hacks: . Research two other Python Libraries NOT DISCUSSED DURING LESSON and make a markdown post, explaining their function and how it helps programmers code. . Matplotlib is a plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. It can be used by programers to create good visuals and is a form of data abstraction. . | Pandas is a library for working with data frames in Python. A data frame is a two-dimensional data structure that consists of rows and columns. It is similar to a spreadsheet or a SQL table. This can be used by programers to easily create things such as the keypads from earlier weeks hacks. . | API&#8217;s . An Application Program Interface, or API, contains specific direction for how the procedures in a library behave and can be used. | An API acts as a gateway for the imported procedures from a library to interact with the rest of your code. | .

Sequencing is Important! . Changing the order of the steps changes the overall outcome, since every time the value assigned to a variable is changed, it overrides the last value which was assigned to the same variable. That is why it is important to track the value of variables, especially in code where the value is constantly changing. . num1 = 2 num2 = 4 num3 = 6 num1 = num2 + num3 # num1 is now 4 + 6, which is 10 num2 = num1 + num3 # num2 is now (the new num1) 10 + 6, which is 16 # output: num1 = 10, num2 = 16, num3 = 6 . VS . num1 = 2 num2 = 4 num3 = 6 num2 = num1 + num3 #num2 is now 8 num1 = num2 + num3 # num1 is now 14 # output: num1 = 14, num2 = 8, num3 = 6 . Tracking Variables . Tracking variables is a common question found on AP exams and is an important thing to keep in mind when writing any code. If the value of your variables changes a lot, not accounting for these changes can result in an unwanted outcome. . var1 = 9 var2 = 7 var3 = 2 #var = var1 + 5 #var2 = var1 - var3 #var1 = var2 #var3 = (var1 + var2) / 2 #var2 = 6 print(var1) print(var2) print(var3) . 9 7 2 .

A string is a collection of characters. What is a character as character can be anything from numbers, letters, spaces, special symbols, etc. . Certain procedures may be used with strings and they vary from programming language to language Python examples . len() to find the length of a string . lower() to convert to lowercase . etc. Pseudocode examples . len() returns the length of a string . concat() returns a string made up of the concatenated strings ex. concat(&quot;string1&quot;, &quot;string2&quot;) would return string1string2 . substring() returns the characters from the string beginning at the at the first position to the last so an example of this would be substring (&quot;abcdefghijk&quot;, 2, 5) would print bcde (pseudocode starts at 1) . String Concatenation . What is string concatenation? . String concatenation is combining 2 or more strings to make a new strings in order to create a new string . concat() in pseudocode and varys from language to language can be used to combine to strings such as concat(&quot;cookie&quot;,&quot;monster&quot;) returns cookiemonster . Substrings . What is a substring? . A substring is a part of and already existing string. . In pseudocode substring() method is used for instance for concat(&quot;Mr.Mortenson is very handsome&quot; 1, 2) the system would return Mr (remember that pseudocode starts at 1) . Hacks . Find the result of the following problems. Then convert the pseudocode to working python code using your knowledge of python string operators. .

            "content": "Unit 3, Section 1.1: Data Types and Variables - Ederick . Essential Knowledge (College Board&#39;s Must Knows): . A variable is an abstraction inside a program that holds a value, where each variable has associated data storage that represents a single value at a time (However, if the value is a collection type such as a list, then the value can contain multiple values). | Variables typically have meaningful names that helps with the overall organization of the code and understanding of what is being represented by the variables | Some programming languages provide a variety of methods to represent data, which are referenced using variables 9Booleans, numbers, lists, and strings) | One form of a value is better suited for representation than antoher. | . What is a Variable? . A variable is an abstraction made inside a program that holds a value. These variables are used in code to refer to more comples values that the variable contains and makes the program code more organized and smoother to run. . Variables can be seen as &quot;containers&quot; and each container has a name that holds what it is supposed to hold. In the following code, we can see that a variable has the value of &quot;Alex.&quot; How can we make the variable appear more organized in the code? . x = &quot;alex&quot; print(x) . alex . Choosing Variables . When choosing variables, it is important to assign the variables name to something that correlates with what the function of the variable is supposed to do. For example, we do not want a variable that is supposed to hold a name be named &quot;age&quot; becaue it can be confusing and mistakes may be more prevalent. . Example: . age = &quot;Timmy&quot; name = &quot;25&quot; print(name + &quot; is &quot; + age) . 25 is Timmy . Notice how age is going to be seen when printing the code. That can lead to confusion | . Data Types . Variables have different data types that store specific kinds of data depending on what is being represented. Some examples are shown below: . integer (numbers) | string (or text/letters) | Boolean (True/False statements) | . These types of data types can be useful when trying to represent a value. For example, you would not want a variable meant to represent someone&#39;s name with an integer. . Questions (College Board&#39;s Essential Knowledge): . What exactly IS a variable? | What is the best data type to represent someone&#39;s dog&#39;s name? | Why is it important to give variables specific names before containing values? | What is the best way to represent someone&#39;s phone number? | Bonus (Not required but important to know): .

The assignment operator looks different for different types of coding languages A variable will take the most recent value assigned | . How do you even store a value inside a variable? . Let&#39;s use python for our example: . In python, the assignment operator is the equal sign (=) | In order to store a value inside a variable, we must: Give the variable a name | place the assignment operator | input the variable value | . | . highscore = 100 # How do you store a number like 3.72? money = 3.72 # What about storing your username (string)? username = &quot;name&quot; # What if it is raining outside and you want to store that fact (boolean)? is_raining = True # What about a list of groceries? groceries = [&quot;eggs&quot;, &quot;flour&quot;, &quot;bread&quot;, &quot;milk&quot;] .

In your own words, briefly explain by writing down what an assignment operator is | In Collegeboard pseudocode, what symbol is used to assign values to variables? | A variable, x, is initially given a value of 15. Later on, the value for x is changed to 22. If you print x, would the command display 15 or 22? | . An assignment operator is a symbol used to assign a value to a variable. For example = in python. . | An arrow to the left pointing from the value towards the variable it should be assigned to. . | The command would display 22, because variables are always the most recently assigned value. . | Hacks: . Copy the all the html code into a markdown file and run your local server. You will then see a decimal to binary converter near the html code.

Mangos . Data Abstraction with Lists - Steven . Data abstraction can be created with lists. . Lists bundle together multiple elements and/or variables under one name are not defined with specified lengths. | The variables that are stored in a list do not have to be limited to one kind of variable. | The user does not need to know how the list stores data (this gives way for data abstraction). | . In the code below, the logic itself works with a list, but the code abstracts it into a sequence of bits in a string (as seen in the input and output). To make this work, the splitbits lists is created and processed. At the end of the code, the result is outputted as a string rather than a list (abstraction). . bits = input(&quot;Input a sequence of bits to invert: &quot;) splitbits = list(bits) for i in range(len(splitbits)): if splitbits[i] == &#39;0&#39;: splitbits[i] = &#39;1&#39; elif splitbits[i] == &#39;1&#39;: splitbits[i] = &#39;0&#39; print(&quot;&quot;.join(splitbits)) . Hacks . The following code is incomplete. Its intended purpose is to increase three numbers, all of which ask for user input, by an amount specified the user. The input code is abstracted, but the actual logic isn&#39;t connected to the abstraction. | . num1=input(&quot;Input a number. &quot;) num2=input(&quot;Input a number. &quot;) num3=input(&quot;Input a number. &quot;) add=input(&quot;How much would you like to add? &quot;) # Add code in the space below # The following is the code that adds the inputted addend to the other numbers.

Managing Complexity with lists - Liav . Long and slow way . By now, everyone should know the &quot;long and slow way&quot; to print a list of something in python It is easy to just assign a value to a single variable | This method is displayed in this example with test scores: | . | . score1 = 95 score2 = 24 score3 = 87 score4 = 92 print(score1, score2, score3, score4) . As you can see, each score is assigned to its relative variable such as &quot;score1 = 95&quot; and then you just print each variable. | However you can make the code segment faster, easier to read, and more efficient... | . Assinging values to one variable . Use square brackets &quot;[]&quot; to store the values of a certain variable, then you can simply print the variable to output your desired list: | . scores = [95, 24, 87, 92] print(scores) . Now instead of having a difference variable and new line of code for each value, the list is simply displayed by assigning each value to a single value that you can now print. | . How lists manage complexity of a program . Simplification . It is much simpler, faster, and easier to code lists this way | Makes the code segment much easier to read | . | Variables . You do not need as many variables, because you can just assign all corresponding values to a single variable | To change a value you don&#39;t have to edit/add/remove an entire variable | . | .

This can create a loop that repeats itself until a specific condition is met. In this case takes a dictionary value and increments itself while adding itself to a sum. This creates a factorial like function, but for addition. For example if you input 1 into this function, it will take 1+2+3+4+5 = 15. . def example_recursive(x): x = int(x) if x &lt; 10: x += 1 x=example_recursive(x) else: print(&quot;End of recursive loop&quot;) return x def example_recursive_dict(dict_obj, NN): #dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;] = int(dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;]) print(&#39;inside example_recursive_dict, val is: &#39;,dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;]) if dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;] &lt; NN: dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;] += 1 dict_obj[&#39;sum&#39;] += dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;] #print(&#39;inside if&#39;) example_recursive_dict(dict_obj, NN) else: print(&quot;End of recursive loop&quot;) #recursive_var = input(&quot;What number should we start with?&quot;) #recursive_var=example_recursive(recursive_var) #print(recursive_var) def example_by_reference(dict_obj): dict_obj[&#39;val&#39;] += 1 dict_test = {&#39;val&#39;: 2, &#39;sum&#39;: 0} print(dict_test[&#39;val&#39;]) example_by_reference(dict_test) print(dict_test[&#39;val&#39;]) example_by_reference(dict_test) print(dict_test[&#39;val&#39;]) dict_test[&#39;val&#39;] = 0 dict_test[&#39;sum&#39;] = 0 example_recursive_dict(dict_test, 5) print(&#39;summation is done, value is: &#39;, dict_test[&#39;sum&#39;]) . 2 3 4 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 0 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 1 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 2 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 3 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 4 inside example_recursive_dict, val is: 5 End of recursive loop summation is done, value is: 15 .",
