    "# Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "* A library is a collection of precompiled codes that can be used later on in a program for some specific well-defined operations. \n",
    "* These precompiled codes can be referred to as modules. Each module contains bundles of code that can be used repeatedly in different programs.\n",
    "* A library may also contain documentation, configuration data, message templates, classes, and values, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why are libraries important?\n",
    "* Using Libraries makes Python Programming simpler and convenient for the programmer. \n",
    "* One example would be through looping and iteration, as we don’t need to write the same code again and again for different programs. \n",
    "* Python libraries play a very vital role in fields of Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Visualization, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A few libraries that simplify coding processes:\n",
    "* **Pillow** allows you to work with images.\n",
    "* **Tensor Flow** helps with data automation and monitors performance.\n",
    "* **Matplotlib** allows you to make 2D graphs and plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AP Exam Refrence Sheet itself is a library!\n",
    "![Screenshot 2022-12-11 221853](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51098969/206974627-af98327c-d95d-4459-be67-cbaa3faaaa98.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hacks:\n",
    "Research two other Python Libraries NOT DISCUSSED DURING LESSON and make a markdown post, explaining their function and how it helps programmers code.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Matplotlib is a plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. It can be used by programers to create good visuals and is a form of data abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pandas is a library for working with data frames in Python. A data frame is a two-dimensional data structure that consists of rows and columns. It is similar to a spreadsheet or a SQL table. This can be used by programers to easily create things such as the keypads from earlier weeks hacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### API’s\n",
    "* An Application Program Interface, or API, contains specific direction for how the procedures in a library behave and can be used. \n",
    "* An API acts as a gateway for the imported procedures from a library to interact with the rest of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activity: Walkthrough with NumPy\n",
    "* Install NumPy on VSCode:\n",
    "    1. Open New Terminal In VSCode:\n",
    "    2. pip3 install --upgrade pip\n",
    "    3. pip install numpy \n",
    " \n",
